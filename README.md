# Loan-repayment-predictive-model
To predict likelihood of customers repaying their loan

Project description: This model predicts the likelihood of new customers repaying back their loan. 

Project architecture: A few models were developed using different classifiers and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model. The Gradient boosted decision tree, Random Forest classifier and Decision tree, turned out to produce better performance than others. Besides the predictive model, exploratory data analysis was done to better understand the categories of customers of customers in the data with a possibility of grouping them into segments by their common characteristics.

Data source: The dataset is based on American credit risk problem, but the features and problem statements are relevant in the UK.

Model evaluation: The models were evaluated using five different metrics; accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix and f1-score. The results were visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.
